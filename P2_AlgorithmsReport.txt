********************************************************************

This practice consists in comparing two sorting algorithms, Insert Sort and Shell
Sort. Next, we will show the details of the measurements taken.

EXERCISES:

Exercises 1 and 2

We started by implementing the algorithms. We turned into C code the pseudocode
given and then checked wheter they gave the expected result. For it we used the
prompt given, and created a print_array and an is_sorted function. Everything went
correctly so we proceeded to take measurements.
